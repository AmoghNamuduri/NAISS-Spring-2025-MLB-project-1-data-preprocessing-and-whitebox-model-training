# Titanic Survival Prediction using RandomForest

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning, preprocessing, and training a classification model on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn is used to build the model.

## Libraries Required

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, splitting datasets, and evaluating models.
- **seaborn**: For data visualization, especially the confusion matrix heatmap.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.
